## Hi there 👋

#### I'm Luanico, an AI engineering student at EPITA in Paris.

---

### Here is some of my favourite projects:

- A [Visual Tracking](https://github.com/Luanico/ML-Visual-Tracking) project based on a YOLO backbone.
- A [CUDA Inference](https://github.com/Luanico/CUDA-Inference) tool written directly in CUDA to run neural network inference faster than PyTorch.
- A [commands classifier/generator](https://github.com/Eldolfin/projet-NLP1) with different NLP methods.

### Currently working on:

- Pushing the CUDA inference tool further (better CNN, making a YOLO model in CUDA)
- School projects for the last year of EPITA

### What I like to work on:

I'm passionate about AI in general, however i'm particularly interested in Computer Vision. Working on AI in Healthcare or defense would be really interesting!
Outside of AI, I dabble in a few other subjects:
- Cybersecurity: While not something i would fully specialize into, I enjoy the field and participated in a Hackaton [(Toulouse Hacking Convention)](https://thcon.party/) in 2024.
- Economic Intelligence: A very interesting field, from the collection of information (OSINT, ...) to the analysis and exploitation of it. A great course at EPITA interested me in this subject.
- I kind of follow Geopolitics, as I find it really interesting to understand what is happening in the world and why. Just my personal curiosity, no works in that!

### And outside of my works?

I enjoy some video games, and always love a great narrative game (play Until Then!), a good team based game, or a nice strategy game. I also enjoy Animes with well made stories.
